  The crate implements a seemingly trivial thing: waiting for a child process
  to finish, with a timeout.
  
  On Windows, this boils down to a single WinAPI call. I don't know much about
  Windows, but the code looks okay to me. There is a minor issue of timeouts
  being capped at â‰ˆ49 days, which I reported:
  https://github.com/alexcrichton/wait-timeout/issues/23
  
  On Unix, the algorithm is much more involved. I understand it, and I believe
  it to be correct.
  
  The crate calls into libc and WinAPI, so there are a bit of `unsafe` in here.
  But it all looks all right to me.
