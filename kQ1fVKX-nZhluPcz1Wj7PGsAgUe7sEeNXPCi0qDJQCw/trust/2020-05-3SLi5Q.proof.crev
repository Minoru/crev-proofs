  @pickfire contributed to my project, Newsboat. He is more knowledgeable
  about Rust than I am, but I need more time to develop trust in his overall
  judgement.

  @kpcyrd contributed to my project, Newsboat. I also know that he is on the
  Rust maintainers team in Debian. We haven't interacted all that much, so
  right now I only have basic trust.

  I know @kornelski only through a few interactions on Mastodon, so have just
  basic trust so far.
